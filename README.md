Yahtzee Rolls
=============

This is a simple Python script that attempts to compute various statistical properties of rolling several fair 6-sided dice repeatedly (saving those you wish) until all the dice show the same number.

A text-based histogram is then shown.

Requirements
============

Only a base install of Python 2+ is required.  The use of `raw_input` precludes the use of Python 3+, though it would be a simple matter to edit the script to work in that environment.
